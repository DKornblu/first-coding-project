# My First Coding Project

Welcome to my very first coding project! 👋  
This website was meant to be dedicated to all things about yours truly, a.k.a. Moi.

## About the Project

This project was created as a prerequisite assignment for admission into a full-stack bootcamp.  
Before diving into programming, I was assigned a short online course covering the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Among the tasks assigned, I was expected to choose my own color theme and font, as well as figure out how to navigate between pages and loop through embedded Google maps.

## What to Expect

In this project, I not only applied my newfound ninja coding skills but also injected a bit of personality into the website.  
I actually took the time to share a bit about myself in a light-hearted and humorous manner,  instead of vomiting out "Lorem Ipsum" everywhere. 🤢 You are welcome.

This project was meant to showcase my basic understanding of coding fundamentals and also to test my ability to keep up with fast paced learning and internalize a chunk of material in a short time. 🤓  
There are also 2-3 easter eggs. Couldn't help myself.

## Special Thanks 🙏

If you've made it this far and even took the time to read this README file, I applaud you!  
You're truly amazing. Top-notch. A cut above. Cream of the cream.

Have the best day ever!
